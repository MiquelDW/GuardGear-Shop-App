  // ESLint rules are predefined guidelines that ESLint uses to analyze and enforce code quality and style. They define what is considered an error or a warning in your code
  // Turn off "react/no-unescaped-entities" rule, this rule in ESLint ensures that certain characters (like <, >, {, }, ", and ') are properly escaped in JSX, but you don't need it in your codebase
